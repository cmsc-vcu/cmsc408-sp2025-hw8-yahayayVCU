# cmsc408-sp2025 - Homework 8 - World Bank Indicator Analysis

    Name: Adam Yasin Yahaya

- The purpose of this assignment is to explore and analyze global development data from the World Bankâ€™s World Development Indicators (WDI) database by loading large CSV datasets into a MySQL schema, cleaning and filtering the data, and then writing SQL queries to answer a series of analytical questions. You will connect to the database from within a Quarto report, inspect table structures, count and sample records, identify and correct data anomalies, and perform increasingly complex aggregations, joins, pivots, and percentage calculations. Through this process, you will gain hands-on experience in data ingestion, transformation, and querying at scale, as well as learn how to present your findings in a reproducible, narrative-driven HTML report.

- The files that have been modified are the _quarto.yml file, the report.qmd file, the loader.qmd file, and the README.md file. These files can be navigated by scrolling up and down. This assignment also utilized the CSV files from World Bank data catalog of [world development Indicators]
